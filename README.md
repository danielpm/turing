# Turing Machine

A turing machine in javascript.

## Running

All code is a single file, download it, open it and edit it.

Use the querystring to change the tape, edit the source to change the table of instructions.

The default example will do a sum by one in a little-endian boolean string finished with an 'e'. Have fun.
